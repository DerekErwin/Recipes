            <li>4 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>4 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cold water</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the oil to a Dutch Oven, or a large, heavy-bottom pot.</li>
            <li>Cook the beef in batches over medium heat until brown. Ensure to cook on all sides and move to a plate while cooking the rest. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot.</li>
            <li>When the beef is all browned, dissolve the beef bouillon in hot water and then add to the pot.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the beef back into the pot, with the liquid and seasonings.</li>
            <li>Bring everything to a boil before reducing the heat to a low simmer and covering with the lid.</li>
            <li>Leave the beef to simmer for an hour, checking occasionally and stirring to prevent anything from sticking.</li>
            <li>While the beef cooks, wash, peel, and cut your vegetables. Be careful not to cut them too small, so that they keep their form after cooking.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, make a u201cslurryu201d using the cornstarch and 2 teaspoons of water. Mix it thoroughly until totally smooth.</li>
            <li>After an hour, add in the vegetables and slurry, stirring everything through.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and let simmer for another hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Serve in a big bowl with crusty French bread.</li>
